# Super Hero Card Brawl

## Rules

Welcome to Super Hero Card Brawl. You play red cards. Your opponent are black cards. You win if you can fold all black cards. Each card is a hero. The brawl plays out in waves. Each wave contains four cards. You complete a wave by folding all four cards in the wave. After that you get a new wave of four cards until you either get knocked out or knock out (fold) all opponents cards.

### Spades and Clubs are opponent brawlers

The spades and clubs are the opponent. When you fold them, they will attack you, dealing damage equal to their value. If you survive the attack, you defeat the enemy.

### The Jokers are opponent bosses

The two joker cards are bosses -- extremely powerful opponents that lead the opponents team. In fact, they are so strong, that meeting them without an brawler on your side is sure to get you knocked out once and for all! Be extremely cautious when you meet them.

### Tiles are your offensive brawlers

The tiles are offensive brawlers. When you fold them, they engage and provide defense from opponent attacks. When a opponent attacks you, the brawler will reduce the amount of damage you take by its own value. If the opponent is weaker than the brawlers defense, their attack will not hurt you at all!

However, there's a catch. After a enemy hits your brawler, your brawler loose some stamina and will be unable to withstand attacks from equal or stronger opponents without getting knocked out and leaving you unguarded. To prevent that, be sure to attack stronger opponents before weaker ones!

### Hearts are your defensive brawlers

The hearts are defensive brawlers. When you fold them, they will engage and restore an amount of health equal to their value.

However, there's another catch. Your health can only take one boost at the time. If you try to use two or more heart cards in a row, the latter ones will do nothing.

### Move pass a wave

You may slip pass a wave of brawlers, if you have not slipped pass the previous one or have handled all the opponents in the current wave. When slipping pass, the remaining cards are shuffled back into the deck.
