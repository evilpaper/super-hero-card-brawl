# Super Hero Card Brawl

## How to play

A standard deck of 54 cards, jokers included, is a brawl. Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards, display them before you, this is a round. A round ends when all the cards are folded.

#### ♥︎ Heart Potions

A potion gives you health points equal to its value, up to a maximum of 21 health points.

Drinking multiple potions in a row will make you sick and result in no extra healing, only the first potion's value will be gained in HP. Potions are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.
